Speaker A: Hey, um, are you coming to the meeting later?
Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. Like, it starts at 3, right?
Speaker A: You know, I thought it was 2:30.
Speaker B: Oh, right, I totally forgot. Thanks for the reminder!
Speaker A: No worries. It's just that, um, I always forget these things.
Speaker B: Same here. I was going to set a reminder but, like, I got distracted.
Speaker A: Happens to the best of us.
Speaker B: So, are we presenting today?
Speaker A: I believe so. You know, I hope we're ready.
Speaker B: Well, we've practiced enough. Let’s just go with the flow.
Speaker A: That’s the spirit!
Speaker B: Let’s do this.
